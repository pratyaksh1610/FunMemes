# :rocket: FunMemes

:heavy_check_mark: Developed an android app using `Kotlin` programming language. 

:heavy_check_mark: Used `Glide` Library for image handling and processing.   

:heavy_check_mark: Used `Volley` Library for networking and API requests.

:heavy_check_mark: Developed an explore section which fetches cool memes from reddit through an open-source `API` in Kotlin.

:heavy_check_mark: It has a `SHARE` button through which one can share memes through any means.

:heavy_check_mark: I have also added a functionality to `store` memes on the device.
